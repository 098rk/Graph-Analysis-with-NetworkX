Graph Analysis with NetworkX

## Notebook 1: Graph Types:

[Click here to see the notebook](https://github.com/KangboLu/Graph-Analysis-with-NetworkX/blob/main/01_graph_types.ipynb)

This notebook covers how to create the following graphs using NetworkX:
1. Undirected graph
2. Directed graph
3. Signed graph
4. Weighted graph
5. Multigraph
6. Bipartite Graph
7. Projected Graph

## Notebook 2: Spring Layout:

## Notebook 3: Graph Statistics:

[Click here to see the notebook part 1](https://github.com/KangboLu/Graph-Analysis-with-NetworkX/blob/main/03_graph_statistics_part_1.ipynb)

Notebook part 1 covers how to calculate and interpret graph statistics for the following topic:
1. Triadic Closer:  
    * Local Clustering Coefficient (LCC)  
    * Global Clustering Coefficient (GCC): Average LCC and Transitivity  
2. Distance Measures:
    * Average Distance (Average Shortest Path Length)  
    * Eccentricity
    * Diameter
    * Radius
    * Center
    * Periphery
